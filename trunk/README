Instructions to build the trunk17 compiler.

Add the following to your environment in either .bash_profile or .bashrc 
  export TRUNK_REPOS=$HOME/git/trunk17.0

Then log in again

mkdir -p $TRUNK_REPOS
cd $TRUNK_REPOS
git clone https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project
$TRUNK_REPOS/aomp/trunk/build_trunk.sh 

To save time, instead of cloning a new trunk repo, you can move or
copy your current trunk repo to $TRUNK_REPOS/llvm-project.

In the future, there will be a new clone_trunk.sh script that will 
clone or pull updates on all the repos in $TRUNK_REPOS except aomp. 
This will be similar to the clone_aomp.sh script.
For now, there is only the trunk repo (llvm-project) needed to build_trunk.sh.

The script build_trunk.sh will install trunk into $HOME/rocm/trunk_17.0-0
Furthermore, there will be a symolic link from $HOME/rocm/trunk to the
install directory.

To use the various AOMP testing infrastructure in $TRUNK_REPOS/aomp/test 
export AOMP=$HOME/rocm/trunk

Then for example,
cd $TRUNK_REPOS/aomp/test/smoke/vmuldemo
make run

A various development points we will qualify releases of trunk17 
and increment the development version.  For example, after the release
of trunk_17.0-0, development will move to trunk_17.0-1.
