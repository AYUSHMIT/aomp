HOWTO BUILD THE trunk17 COMPILER

Add the following to your environment in either .bash_profile or .bashrc 

export TRUNK_REPOS=$HOME/git/trunk17.0

or set TRUNK_REPOS to a location with a fast file system.
Then log in again and execute these commands:

mkdir -p $TRUNK_REPOS
cd $TRUNK_REPOS
git clone https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp
git clone https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/llvm-project
cd llvm-project
git checkout amd-trunk-dev
$TRUNK_REPOS/aomp/trunk/build_trunk.sh 

The default value for environment variable TRUNK_LINK is $HOME/rocm/trunk
The build_trunk.sh script will install into directory ${TRUNK_LINK}_17.0-0
Furthermore, it creates a symbolic link from $TRUNK_LINK to the install dir.
So $TRUNK_LINK must not be a physical directory. This symbolic link
makes it easy to switch between qualifed releases of trunk17.
If you are on a system with slow filesystem for $HOME directory,set TRUNK_LINK
to where you want the install directory to be. For example set the following
in your .bash_profile or .bashrc then relogin:

export TRUNK_LINK=/work/$USER/rocm/trunk

Then the install scripts will install into /work/$USER/rocm/trunk_17.0-0
and a symlink will be created from $TRUNK_LINK.


RELEASES OF trunk17.

At various development check points we will qualify releases of trunk17
and increment the development version in trunk_common_vars. For example,
after the release of trunk_17.0-0, development will move to trunk_17.0-1.
The build scripts will then install into directory $HOME/rocm/trunk_17.0-1.
The symbolic link from $HOME/rocm/trunk will also change to the new
install directory.

After a trunk17 release, a static release branch will be created.
such as trunk_17.0-0. This branch will be created by interactive
rebasing all the local commits in amd-trunk-dev. Development will
continue in the branch amd-trunk-dev.


UPDATES FROM OTHER TEAM MEMBERS

In the future, there will be a new clone_trunk.sh script that will 
clone or pull updates on all the repos in $TRUNK_REPOS except aomp. 
This will be similar to the clone_aomp.sh script used for aomp.
For now, simply run 'git pull' in the repository directory to
get updates from other team members or merges from main.


TESTING trunk17
 
To use the various AOMP testing infrastructure in $TRUNK_REPOS/aomp/test
export AOMP=$HOME/rocm/trunk
or if you set TRUNK_LINK use this command
export AOMP=$TRUNK_LINK

Then for example,
cd $TRUNK_REPOS/aomp/test/smoke/vmuldemo
make run


MERGE FROM MAIN PROCESS

At any time during the development, the development branch amd-trunk-dev can
be updated from main by any team member with the script merge_from_main.sh.
This script carefully runs the git commands to merge from main.
This script ensures that neither the main branch nor amd-trunk-dev branch has
local changes. Save any of your local changes before using merge_from_main.sh.
Note: the main branch of https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/llvm-project
is automatically mirrored from llvm trunk (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project)
main branch every three hours.

Before running merge_from_main.sh, ensure amd-trunk-dev is indeed behind main
by looking at URL https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/llvm-project/branches
or by running this command:

git rev-list --left-right --count main...amd-trunk-dev

The script terminates if it finds that amd-trunk-dev is 0 commits behind main.
