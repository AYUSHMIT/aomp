Instructions to build the trunk17 compiler.

Add the following to your environment in either .bash_profile or .bashrc 
export TRUNK_REPOS=$HOME/git/trunk17.0
Then log in again.

mkdir -p $TRUNK_REPOS
cd $TRUNK_REPOS
git clone https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp
git clone https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/llvm-project
cd llvm-project
git checkout trunk_17.0-0
$TRUNK_REPOS/aomp/trunk/build_trunk.sh 

The script build_trunk.sh will install trunk into $HOME/rocm/trunk_17.0-0
Furthermore, it creates a symolic link from $HOME/rocm/trunk to the
install directory.

At various development check points we will qualify releases of trunk17
and increment the development version in trunk_common_vars. For example,
after the release of trunk_17.0-0, development will move to trunk_17.0-1.
and the scripts will install into $HOME/rocm/trunk_17.0-0 and the 
symbolic link from $HOME/rocm/trunk will changes.  At that time, 
a new development branch will also be created to track the next
qualified release. 

In the future, there will be a new clone_trunk.sh script that will 
clone or pull updates on all the repos in $TRUNK_REPOS except aomp. 
This will be similar to the clone_aomp.sh script used for aomp.
For now, other than the build scripts in the aomp repo, 
there is only a single repo (llvm-project) needed to build_trunk.sh.

To use the various AOMP testing infrastructure in $TRUNK_REPOS/aomp/test
export AOMP=$HOME/rocm/trunk

Then for example,
cd $TRUNK_REPOS/aomp/test/smoke/vmuldemo
make run
