The AOMP component build scripts implement cmake and make for each component 
when called with no argument. The scripts implement "make install"  when called
with the install argument. The high level build_aomp.sh script calls the component
build script for an ordered series of components.
The build directory for each component is $BUILD_DIR/build/<COMPONNENT NAME>
The default value for BUILD_DIR is AOMP_REPOS . 

There is a feature that most people do not use called COPYSOURCE.  It copies 
source code via rsync to another directory when BUILD_DIR is overridden and it does 
not equal AOMP_REPOS with this logic in aomp_common_vars.

if [ "$BUILD_DIR" != "$AOMP_REPOS" ] ; then
   COPYSOURCE=true
fi

COPYSOURCE is only used in these component builds
	build_flang_runtime.sh
	build_flang.sh
	build_libdevice.sh
	build_openmp.sh
	build_pgmath.sh
	build_project.sh
So there is inconsistent use of COPYSOURCE.  Also the condition for COPYSOURCE
prevents putting the BUILD_DIR somewhere else or you will get COPYSOURCE activated
which can be frustrating.

I propose to:
   1. Eliminate the COPYSOURCE feature to make build scripts simpler and more consistent.
   2. Change name BUILD_DIR to AOMP_BUILD_DIR_BASE. These features will not change. 
       - The default value for AOMP_BUILD_DIR_BASE will be AOMP_REPOS.
       - The build dir for all components will be $AOMP_BUILD_DIR_BASE/build/<COMPONENT NAME>
